' NOTE:
'  If a function is marked as optional, that means it may do nothing (either unimplemented
'  or irrelevant to the backend) and that a backend doesn't need to set the function pointer:
'  instead the pointer must be valid and set to a default in set_default_gfx_function_ptrs.
'  On the other hand "(optional, ptr may be NULL)", means the default is a NULL pointer.
'  Possibly-NULL function pointers are very much discouraged. They're used as a simple way
'  to indicate whether the function is implemented, or where calling an unimplemented function
'  would be an unnecessary performance hit.

' This is used by dynamically linked backends to report their compatibility
' (returned by gfx_getversion).
' Increment this when a change means that both the backend and the engine can't
' support previous versions.
' It isn't incremented when an optional feature is added to the API,
' (such as by increasing WINDOWSTATE_SZ), and might not be incremented if
' the engine can detect incompatible backends by missing functions.
' 1 - Original version, but there were actually multiple incompatible breaks
' 2 - Changes to Surface (inc. addition of pitch)
