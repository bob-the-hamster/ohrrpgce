'These constants also need to be updated in slices.bas and plotscr.hsd
'and plotdict.xml. You may choose to just update them here and then run
' misc/sl_lookup.py
'to update the other files. Be aware that once you have picked a number
'for one of these, you should not change it, because it could get used
'as a constant in someone's script, and changing it would break any
'non-recompiled script that used it.
'Lookup codes starting with SL_EDITOR are for editor slice collections in
'Custom, and aren't included in plotscr.hsd/plotdict.xml. Other lookup
'codes can also be omitted from plotscr.hsd/plotdict.xml by adding a
'comment containing "Hide".
'Multiple names for a lookup code can be defined by adding a comment
'containing "Alias" in ones after the first. The first name is the main one.
'Other comments are ignored.
